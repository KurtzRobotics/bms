BMS Project - README
<!-- This README is intentionally minimal, providing a placeholder structure for the BMS project. Fill in each section as the design and implementation evolve. -->
Overview
Short description of the BMS project’s purpose and goals. For example:

“This BMS project aims to create a flexible, high-power Battery Management System with advanced monitoring, configurable cell balancing, and safety features.”

Features (Planned)
Cell Monitoring: Handling up to 14 lithium-ion cells
High-Current Support: ±100A capability
Dynamic Configuration: Series/parallel reconfiguration
Safety Protections: Over/Under voltage, Overcurrent, Short-circuit
Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or wired interfaces for real-time data
Project Status
Currently in conceptual/design phase. No finalized PCB or firmware yet.

Getting Started
To be updated once initial hardware and firmware designs exist.

Usage
Placeholder for instructions or examples showing how to use or test the BMS.

Hardware & Firmware
Placeholder sections for schematics, PCB layouts, microcontroller code, etc.

Hardware
Schematics (coming soon)
PCB Layout (coming soon)
Firmware
Instructions for building/flashing (coming soon)
Dependencies (coming soon)
Roadmap
Initial Schematic & Architecture (underway)
Prototype Board Fabrication (planned)
Firmware Implementation (planned)
Integration & Testing (planned)
Contributing
We welcome ideas and feedback!

Contribution guidelines will be added once the initial repository structure is in place.

License
License details to be determined.

Note: Update each section with detailed content once components, PCB layouts, and firmware design are established. This template serves as a placeholder to keep the repository organized while the project is still in early development.
